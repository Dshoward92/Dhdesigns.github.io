     <p>My name is Dylan Howard, I am 24 years old and from Los Angeles, California.
  I am married to my beautiful wife Esmeralda August 19, 2016 and we currently live in Rexburg, 
  Idaho attending BYU-I and will graduate this July, 2017. I am studying 
  communications with an an emphasis in Public Relations and Organizational Advocacy. 
  I am currently seeking internships and job opportunities for after graduation. I have
  always been an adventurer and love to explore places, meet new people, and try new things.

  within my power to help those I care about. You will find that I am an extremely hard
